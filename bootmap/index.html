        <h2>Design Request</h2>
        <h3>Non-Profit: Coalition Against Hunger</h3>
        <div class="span4">
          <h3>Goal:</h3>
          <p> In February/March 2013, the Coalition will release its first-ever “Hunger in Pennsylvania” report, publishing the most comprehensive data and analysis available on hunger and poverty for each of the state’s 67 counties. In addition to producing a hardcopy report that would be downloadable online, the Coalition would like to create an interactive hunger map of Pennsylvania’s counties—a tool that would undoubtedly raise awareness and increase engagement in the issue of hunger among members of the public, media and government.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h3>Key Message:</h3>
          <p>Hunger exists in every community in Pennsylvania, and there are many programs that can help, if we ensure that all people have access to them.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h3>Primary Audience:</h3>
          <p>This online interactive map is intended for a combination of Pennsylvania audiences—the media, anti-hunger organizations, social service agencies, educators, policymakers, as well as members of the general public.</p>
